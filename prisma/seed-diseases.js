    name: 'Cholera',
    overview: 'A severe diarrheal disease caused by Vibrio cholerae bacteria. Cholera spreads through contaminated water and food, particularly in areas with poor sanitation. It can cause rapid dehydration and death if untreated, but is easily preventable and treatable.',
    symptoms: ['Watery diarrhea', 'Vomiting', 'Rapid dehydration', 'Muscle cramps', 'Shock', 'Low blood pressure'],
    causes: 'Caused by Vibrio cholerae bacteria found in contaminated water sources, particularly in areas with poor sanitation. The bacteria produce toxins that cause massive fluid loss through diarrhea.',
    prevention: ['Drink safe, boiled or bottled water', 'Eat hot, fully cooked food', 'Avoid raw or undercooked seafood', 'Practice good hand hygiene', 'Use proper sanitation facilities', 'Get vaccinated if traveling to high-risk areas'],
    treatment: 'Immediate oral rehydration therapy (ORT) is the primary treatment. Severe cases may require intravenous fluids and antibiotics like doxycycline or azithromycin. Early treatment has a very high success rate.',
    slug: 'cholera'
  },
  {
    name: 'Diarrhea',
    overview: 'Frequent loose, watery stools that can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. While often mild, severe diarrhea can be life-threatening, especially in children and elderly people.',
    symptoms: ['Loose, watery stools', 'Abdominal cramps', 'Nausea', 'Bloating', 'Dehydration', 'Fever (in some cases)'],
    causes: 'Can be caused by various bacteria (E. coli, Salmonella), viruses (rotavirus, norovirus), parasites, or consuming contaminated water and food. Poor hygiene and sanitation increase risk.',
    prevention: ['Drink clean, safe water', 'Wash hands frequently with soap', 'Eat properly cooked food', 'Avoid street food in high-risk areas', 'Use proper food storage', 'Maintain good personal hygiene'],
    treatment: 'Oral rehydration therapy is key. Rest and gradual return to normal diet. Medical attention needed if symptoms persist more than 2 days or if signs of severe dehydration appear.',
    slug: 'diarrhea'

  {
    name: 'Typhoid',
    overview: 'A bacterial infection caused by Salmonella typhi that affects the whole body. It spreads through contaminated food and water and can be fatal if not treated promptly with antibiotics.',

    name: 'Hepatitis A',

  },
  {
    name: 'Dysentery',
    overview: 'Severe intestinal inflammation causing bloody diarrhea. Can be caused by bacteria (shigellosis) or parasites (amebic dysentery). It\'s more serious than regular diarrhea and requires prompt medical attention.',
    symptoms: ['Bloody diarrhea', 'Severe stomach cramps', 'Fever', 'Nausea and vomiting', 'Dehydration', 'Urgency to defecate'],
    causes: 'Caused by Shigella bacteria or Entamoeba histolytica parasite, spread through contaminated water, food, or direct contact with infected persons.',

    causes: 'Caused by Salmonella bacteria found in contaminated food (especially eggs, poultry, meat) and water. Can also spread through contact with infected animals.',
    prevention: ['Cook food thoroughly', 'Refrigerate food promptly', 'Avoid cross-contamination', 'Wash hands after handling raw meat', 'Drink pasteurized dairy products', 'Avoid raw eggs'],
    treatment: 'Usually supportive care with fluids and rest. Antibiotics are typically not recommended as they may prolong bacterial shedding. Severe cases may require hospitalization.',
